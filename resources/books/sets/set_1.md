				Think Like a Programmer: An Introduction to Creative Problem
				Solving
				<br />
				2nd Edition
				<br /><br />
				2019, 9781492054504
			</td>
			<td width="50%">
				The real challenge of programming isn't learning a language's
				syntax—it's learning to creatively solve problems so you can
				build something great. In this one-of-a-kind text, author V.
				Anton Spraul breaks down the ways that programmers solve
				problems and teaches you what other introductory books often
				ignore: how to Think Like a Programmer. Each chapter tackles a
				single programming concept, like classes, pointers, and
				recursion, and open-ended exercises throughout challenge you to
				apply your knowledge. You'll also learn how to:
				<ul>
					<li>
						Split problems into discrete components to make them
						easier to solve
					</li>
					<li>
						Make the most of code reuse with functions, classes, and
						libraries
					</li>
					<li>
						Pick the perfect data structure for a particular job
					</li>
					<li>
						Master more advanced programming tools like recursion
						and dynamic memory
					</li>
					<li>
						Organize your thoughts and develop strategies to tackle
						particular types of problems
					</li>
				</ul>
				<br /><br />
				Although the book's examples are written in C++, the creative
				problem-solving concepts they illustrate go beyond any
				particular language; in fact, they often reach outside the realm
				of computer science. As the most skillful programmers know,
				writing great code is a creative art—and the first step in
				creating your masterpiece is learning to Think Like a
				Programmer.
