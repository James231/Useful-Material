# Destroy all software
Destroy All Software is my go-to resource for bringing new programmers, especially self-taught developers, 
up to speed with Computation. These screencasts are geared toward people who want to learn what it looks 
like to sit down and make software. 
The author generally takes an approach called "Exception Driven Development" where he will write 
what he wants to do, run the program, read the error, and make the change. He does this consistently 
and shows you how to get into the mindset of having a conversation with your compiler by using it as 
a part of your tool chain as a debugger instead of treating it like spell check. 
This also covers topics like how to make a microservice. How to crawl a git log of commit history. 
How to build your own framework. Build your own compiler, shell, text editor, data compressor, 
HTTP server, etc...
Best part? He's fast as hell and generally gets it done in less than half the time of your usual TV episode.

Not a free service.

# Harward introduction to computer science
For some that might not have heard of it. Harvard introduction to Computer Science can be accessed for free.
Lectures in it are just pure joy to watch, David J. Malan has an incredible gift of teaching basics.
If your just starting to learn, definitely worth giving it a try, even just the lectures.
Course uses mostly C language at start with some helpers from cs50 team ( like strings ),
that makes it more approachable, but what you can learn scales very well to other c languages.

# C# boot camp "From Zero To Hero"
"Programming is hard". Yes, but not harder than running a marathon for a person who has never run. 
It's not harder than building a house if you never built one. Programming is hard only until 
you practice it (like any other skill). I would like to invite you to learn programming and 
C# following this course. Ignite passion for finding little miracles in code every day 🙂
